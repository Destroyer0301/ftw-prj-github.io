            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems such as
                hardware, software and data from cyberthreats. The practice is used by individuals and enterprises to
                protect against unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized systems.

                A strong cybersecurity strategy can provide a good security posture against malicious attacks designed
                to access, alter, delete, destroy or extort an organization's or user's systems and sensitive data.
